# TODO - Backlog

## Future ideas (AI + enterprise + emotional + design)
- [ ] AI-calculated profile summary: spiritual and emotional score derived from answers (sentiment, themes, reflection depth) with confidence and evidence snippets.
- [ ] AI semantic tagging of responses (virtues, struggles, gratitude, stressors) to power filtering and trend views.
- [ ] AI weekly narrative: highlights, risks, and suggested next steps with opt-in feedback ("useful" or "not useful").
- [ ] AI question generator: follow-up prompts based on recent answers and long-term goals.
- [ ] Advanced scoring formulas: weighted EMA by recency, category normalization, variance/stability index, and missing-data imputation.
- [ ] Confidence intervals for summary metrics and anomaly detection for sudden mood or behavior shifts.
- [ ] Enterprise features: organizations, teams, RBAC, audit logs, data retention policies, export, and SSO (SAML or OIDC).
- [ ] Emotional support UX: guided reflection flows, trigger check-ins, gentle prompts, and privacy/consent controls.
- [ ] Advanced UI motion and design: animated charts, skeleton loaders, section transitions, and richer library navigation.
- [ ] Accessibility and localization: WCAG checks, keyboard flows, and i18n for core screens.
